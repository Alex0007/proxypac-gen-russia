A starter kit for Ember

Your Ember.js project is almost ready! Here's how to get started:

- Start writing your app in js/app.js.

- Describe your application HTML in index.html.

- During development, you can link to js/libs/ember-*.js to get the
  unminified version of Ember.js.

- Add CSS to css/style.css

- Open index.html in your browser

Tests
=====

This starter kit comes with an integration test sample, written for QUnit runner. 

You can run the tests by opening the `index.html?test` page in your browser.

The test is located in the `tests/tests.js` file. You can see how such an 
integration test should be written, using QUnit assertions and ember-testing helpers.
